### J.R.R.T {#id2}
Far over the misty mountains cold  
To dungeons deep and caverns old  
We must away, ere break of day  
To seek our pale enchanted gold  
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells  
While hammers fell like ringing bells  
In places deep, where dark things sleep  
In hollow halls beneath the fells  
For ancient king and elvish lord  
There many a gleaming golden hoard  
They shaped and wrought, and light they caught  
To hide in gems on hilt of sword  
On silver necklaces they strung  
The flowering stars on crowns they hung  
The dragon-fire in twisted wire  
They meshed the light of moon and sun  
Far over the misty mountains cold  
To dungeons deep and caverns old  
We must away, ere break of day  
To claim our long-forgotten gold  
Goblets they carved there for themselves  
And harps of gold, where no man delves  
There lay they long, and many a song  
Was sung unheard by men or elves  
The pines were roaring on the heights  
The winds was moaning in the night  
The fire was red, it flaming spread  
The trees like torches blazed with light  
The bells were ringing in the dale  
And men looked up with faces pale  
The dragon's ire, more fierce than fire  
Laid low their towers and houses frail
